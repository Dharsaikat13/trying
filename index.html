                    <h3>Rest</h3>
                    <p>You should rest for 10 minutes in Savasana- a “nap” to do after a yoga practice. It is a fully conscious try aimed at being awake, yet completely relaxed. Usually the teacher will instruct you to close your eyes and eliminate the tension in your body and mind</p>

                    <h3>Take a bath</h3>
                    <p>After doing yoga, cool down the body for 30 minutes before taking a shower. Let the sweating dry from the outside and let the body become in the normal temperature, and then you can take a shower. However, many practitioners suggest that it’s better to take bath before yoga, as it freshens up your mind and body, and at the same time improves your ability to focus.</p>

                    <h3>Hydrate yourself</h3>
                    <p>Make sure to re-hydrate and restore electrolytes after practicing yoga, thus plain water or coconut water are great options. Alcohol should be avoided after practice, as you just spent at least 60 minutes sweating out ounces of water and your body is dehydrated.</p>

                    <h3>Eat on time</h3>
                    <p>Yoga should be done on an empty stomach or light stomach. Before going to your yoga class, make sure that your stomach and bowels are empty. Do not eat any heavy meals less than three hours before the yoga practice; however a little bit of fruit until an hour before practice is still acceptable. Practicing on a full stomach is bound to make you uncomfortable.</p>

                    <h3>Hydrate well</h3>
                    <p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day leading up to your yoga class. However, don’t try to drink a lot of water right before your class. Filling your stomach and bladder right before exercising your internal organs may be uncomfortable and sometimes even making you nauseous.</p>

                    <h3>Wear comfortable clothes</h3>
                    <p>Your clothes should be able to stretch but not too loose or flowing. Remove any loose jewelry as they may make you uncomfortable. If you have long hair, it’s better to tie it up neatly. Be bare footed; but you can also wear yoga socks.</p>
